# Week-4-Mini-Blog-CNSS

Microblogging site

# INTRO
- The task this week was to build a microblogging website that allow users to submit posts,view posts and also delete posts. Project was not completed so the app is not completely functional.

### To view project
- Clone this repo
- Install dependencies using npm install (optional: to view tests)
- Start the server with node server.js
- Start posting

THEME
- Movie review posts ðŸŽž

### Core
- As an opinionated person, I want to: post my thoughts so others can read them
- As a bored person, I want to: read what other people have posted

#### Stretch
- As an impulsive person, I want to: delete my posts so no one can see them anymore

### Acceptance Criteria
- A page with a form to submit posts, and a page showing all posts
- All static assets served correctly (CSS etc)
- Tests for each server route 
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
